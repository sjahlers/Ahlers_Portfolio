			<p>I am a front-end web developer with experience in creative design and editing.  I attended the front-end web development bootcamp at <a href="http://www.grandcircus.co">Grand Circus Detroit</a>.  The bootcamp was an intensive 10-week course that focused on learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript, including jQuery, AngularJS and more.  I earned my bachelors degree in public relations from Western Michigan University where I graduated cum laude.</p>
			<p>My interest in coding started at a young age, watching my uncle program our family's computer. That lead to dabbling in html coding in high school. I attended college for communications and later worked as an executive assistant, but found that my previous career wasn't very engaging.  I had a renewed desire to create and returned to pursuing coding.  Iâ€™m looking for forward to the challenge coding provides.</p>
			<p>When not busy coding and designing, I enjoy spending time at home with my family in Farmington Hills, Michigan.  I also enjoy traveling, playing pub trivia, and playing French horn in the Farmington Community Band.</p>
